      "description": "Import and delete certificates in Amazon Web Service's Certificate Manager (AWS ACM).\nThis module does not currently interact with AWS-provided certificates. It currently only manages certificates provided to AWS by the user.\n\nThe ACM API allows users to upload multiple certificates for the same domain name, and even multiple identical certificates. This module attempts to restrict such freedoms, to be idempotent, as per the Ansible philosophy. It does this through applying AWS resource \"Name\" tags to ACM certificates.\nWhen I(state=present), if there is one certificate in ACM with a C(Name) tag equal to the C(name_tag) parameter, and an identical body and chain, this task will succeed without effect.\n\nWhen I(state=present), if there is one certificate in ACM a I(Name) tag equal to the I(name_tag) parameter, and a different body, this task will overwrite that certificate.\n\nWhen I(state=present), if there are multiple certificates in ACM with a I(Name) tag equal to the I(name_tag) parameter, this task will fail.\n\nWhen I(state=absent) and I(certificate_arn) is defined, this module will delete the ACM resource with that ARN if it exists in this region, and succeed without effect if it doesn't exist.\n\nWhen I(state=absent) and I(domain_name) is defined, this module will delete all ACM resources in this AWS region with a corresponding domain name. If there are none, it will succeed without effect.\n\nWhen I(state=absent) and I(certificate_arn) is not defined, and I(domain_name) is not defined, this module will delete all ACM resources in this AWS region with a corresponding I(Name) tag. If there are none, it will succeed without effect.\n\nNote that this may not work properly with keys of size 4096 bits, due to a limitation of the ACM API.",
